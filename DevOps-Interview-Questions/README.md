# Github:

* GIT VS SVN: svn is a Centralized Version Control System (CVCS), and Git is a Distributed Version Control System (DVCS).
* what are git hooks: Git hooks are scripts that Git executes before or after events such as: commit, push, and receive. Git hooks are a built-in feature.
* Diff git merge and rebase: GIT Merge and rebase will handle conflicts differently. Rebase will present conflicts one commit at a time where merge will present them all at once.
* Diff git reset and revert: git reset and git revert is that git reset will reset the state of the branch to a previous state by dropping all the changes post the desired commit while git revert will reset to a previous state by creating new reverting commits and keep the original commits.


# Docker:

* Why docker: Easy boot up, Better resource utilization, Environment consistency, Loosely coupled, distributed, elastic, liberated micro-services: applications are broken into smaller, independent pieces and can be deployed and managed dynamically
* How do you monitor docker containers: 
* Can you run a Docker container within a Docker container: Yes you can run Docker inside Docker by running Docker in privileged mode.
* Different types of docker networks: Bridge, host, Overlay, ingress, Macvlan
* How to handle OOM in a Docker container ?


# Kubernates:

* Explain Kubernates master, worker node components ?
* Stateless vs State applications :  Stateless applications don't store any data in the host which makes it ideal for horizontal scaling and microservices. Stateful applications depend on the storage to save state and data, typically databases are stateful applications.
* Kubernates API versioning : To make it easier to eliminate fields or restructure resource representations, Kubernetes supports multiple API versions, each at a different API path, such as /api/v1 or /apis/extensions/v1beta1.

* How to set up https security for a tomcat application
* Different http status codes ?
* What are secure ways to SSH to a server inside a private network from a public location: Citrix, local port forwarding, tunneling.
* Difference between authentication vs authorization: Authentication means confirming your own identity, while authorization means granting access to the system. In simple terms, authentication is the process of verifying who you are, while authorization is the process of verifying what you have access to.
* How does ssl handshake works: https://www.ssl2buy.com/wiki/how-does-an-ssl-certificate-work
* Difference between SSL vs TLS:  SSL and TLS are cryptographic protocols that authenticate data transfer between servers, systems, applications and users. Differ in cipher suites they both offer.
* ipv4 vs ipv6: https://www.guru99.com/difference-ipv4-vs-ipv6.html
* Router VS GATEWAY:
* One way vs Two way SSL handshake: One-way SSL authentication is if the client only verifies the certificate of the server. This validation is done to make sure that it is the expected server, i.e. no man in the middle attack.
Two-way SSL authentication (or better mutual authentication or client authentication) is if the server also verifies the certificate of the client. This is done to authenticate the client against the server using a certificate.
* Explain OSI Open Systems Interconnection ?
* TCP vs HTTP vs SSL : TCP is your Postal Service just focus on delivering, sequencing of packets,T used mechanisms of sequence and acknowledgment, error detection, error recov. HTTP is your letters, words, messages, requests and commands that go into the envelopes.

* SQL vs NOSQL ?
* How does Indexing in SQL work: Indexing work same as searching of data work in database. It uses binary search to search the data.
* Primary vs Foreign Key:
* Optimistic locking vs Pessimistic locking : Optimistic locking is when you check if the record was updated by someone else before you commit the transaction. Pessimistic locking is when you take an exclusive lock so that no one else can start modifying the record.
* Benefits of SQL views


# Java:

* Explain Memory leaks : A Memory Leak is a situation when there are objects present in the heap that are no longer used, but the garbage collector is unable to remove them from memory and, thus they are unnecessarily maintained.
* Causes of memory leaks:
* How to detect memory leaks:https://www.toptal.com/java/hunting-memory-leaks-in-java

* jar vs war vs ear:
     In J2EE application, modules are packaged as EAR, JAR and WAR based on their functionality
JAR: EJB modules which contain enterprise java beans (class files) and EJB deployment descriptor are packed as JAR files with .jar extenstion
WAR: Web modules which contain Servlet class files, JSP Files, supporting files, GIF and HTML files are packaged as JAR file with .war (web archive) extension
EAR: All above files (.jar and .war) are packaged as JAR file with .ear (enterprise archive) extension and deployed into Application Server.
* How can uou deploy same application multiple times on tomcat server ? change the context path
            <Context docBase="c:\path\to\v1\app.war" path="/app/v1"/>
   <Context docBase="c:\path\to\v2\app.war" path="/app/v2"/>
* Active directory vs LDAP: AD is a directory services database, and LDAP is one of the protocols you can use to talk to it.
*  Difference between read timeout, socket timeout and connection timeout: connection timeout: occurs only upon starting the TCP connection. This usually happens if the remote machine does not answer. 
socket timeout: is dedicated to monitor the continuous incoming data flow. If the data flow is interrupted for the specified timeout the connection is regarded as stalled/broken. Of course this only works with connections where data is received all the time..
ReadTime: Timeout to read data
* How do you troubleshoot slow running website ?

# Scripts:

* Write a Terraform configuration that provisions an EC2 instance and creates security group rules restricting access to only SSH IP whitelist. Use variables appropriately to allow the instance to be created in any data center, change the instance type, and change the IP whitelist.
* Write a Dockerfile that installs the latest Python AWS CLI and allows the container run the AWS CLI tool on the command line. The final container image should contain only the necessary elements for support the AWS CLI execution.
* Write a bash script that hits the AWS EC2 local metadata API, and can be run on an EC2 instance to produce `export` statements which set environment variables containing the instance type, IP address, region, and availability zone.
